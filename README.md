# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I have to refector the user and setuser such that i will set user once and consume every time using useContext hook .

also add button to cancel the order for user.
also add from which user this order is in admin orders.


review of products -> I have to make sure that only user order delieverd can write the review. 

banner of the product images -> Also add the two or three photos or banners of the product like the amazon product description.
